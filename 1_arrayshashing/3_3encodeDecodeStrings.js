/* String Encode and Decode

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement "encode" and decode"

Example 1:

Input: ["learning","is","very","hard"]["learning","is","very","hard"]

Output: ["learning","is","very","hard"]

Example 2:

Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]
Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]

Constraints:

0 <= strs.length < 100
0 <= strs[i].length < 200
strs[i] contains only UTF-8 characters.

// Solution - Encoding is the easy part, Decoding is the hard part
