DSA & LeetCode Problems

Keeping track of leetcode problems I've worked on & the concepts behind tackling them.

These problems will be only questions classified as "easy" & "mediums." I'd like to get to "hards" some day but I need to tackle a bit of breadth before depth. This readme will change hopefully one day.

I explicitly want to rewrite them in my own voice for my own learning; going onto the LeetCode website & the problems being seemingly random was the bane of my existence of years ago.

Organizing the problems into their base concepts & then learning the tricks to visualizing/conceptualizing the problems is what I aim to do here. I am using NeetCode.io as a reference.

There is a wealth of information out there from Youtube videos to text explanations that may be better suited for other people, & this repo will not be exhaustive due to my own time constraints.

I would implore you to always google/research further any term that you come across that you don't have a true dictionary definition of. I found that to be really helpful.

There will be some short Data Structure & Algorithm (DSA) txt.files as a baseline in this github.
